# DECISIONS.md — Architectural Decision Records

> Append-only log of architectural decisions made during the build.
> Each ADR follows the template below. Once written, an ADR is never edited — if a decision is reversed, write a new ADR that supersedes it.

### ADR-002: Treat repo root as alz-poc/ — no nested subdirectory

- **Date:** 2026-05-04
- **Section:** 1
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision makers:** claude (structural, low-risk)

**Context:**
PROMPT.md shows `alz-poc/` as the top-level path in the directory tree. The working directory `d:\Azure POC\Azure-Architecture\` already contains the bootstrap files (CLAUDE.md, PROMPT.md, WORKLOG.md, etc.) at its root. Two options: (a) treat the current directory as the repo root and create all subdirectories directly here, or (b) create a nested `alz-poc/` subdirectory inside the existing repo.

**Decision:**
Treat `d:\Azure POC\Azure-Architecture\` as the repo root (equivalent to `alz-poc/`). All directories from the PROMPT.md tree are created directly here, at the same level as CLAUDE.md and WORKLOG.md.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Nested `alz-poc/` subfolder — rejected: bootstrap files already live at the repo root; nesting would split Claude Code workflow files from Terraform files and break the `CLAUDE.md` read-at-start assumption.

**Consequences:**

- Positive: single working directory, no path confusion between Claude workflow files and Terraform structure
- Negative: root is slightly noisier than a clean Terraform project root (contains CLAUDE.md, WORKLOG.md etc.)
- Follow-ups: none

### ADR-001: Use AVM Pattern Module for ALZ Foundation

- **Date:** TBD
- **Section:** 2
- **Status:** Proposed
- **Decision makers:** user, claude

**Context:**
The ALZ pattern can be implemented via (a) the official `Azure/avm-ptn-alz` Terraform pattern module, (b) the older `Azure/caf-enterprise-scale` module, or (c) hand-rolled MG and policy resources.

**Decision:**
Use `Azure/avm-ptn-alz` if a stable version (≥ 0.x) exists at the time Section 2 is built. Fall back to `caf-enterprise-scale` only if the AVM pattern module is not yet GA. Verify at session start.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Hand-rolled — rejected: defeats the purpose of using AVM and adds maintenance burden
- `caf-enterprise-scale` only — rejected for primary path: AVM is the forward-looking standard

**Consequences:**
- Positive: aligned with current Microsoft guidance, less custom code to maintain
- Negative: AVM pattern modules are newer and may have rough edges
- Follow-ups: re-verify module version on the day Section 2 is built
